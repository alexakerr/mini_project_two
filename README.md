Hello !
When you first open this app you will have options to add, edit, delete, search, display, or eport your contacts.
When you select add a contact, you will add the name, 10 digit number(which can be used to search for this contact in the future),
email, and anything additional info you would like to add.
When you would like to edit a contact, you will enter 2 from the menu and use that 10 digit number to look up which 
contact you would like to edit. The app will then go through which information you would like to edit.
Meaning you will first have the option to edit the name by just entering the new name, and if you dont wish to edit the name 
you would just hit enter to go through the next options and repeat (phone number, email, additional info).
When you would like to delete a contact, you will enter 3 and you would just enter their correct 10 digit phone number and if it is not
entered correctly you would have another chance to enter the valid phone number.
When you want to search for a contact, you will enter 4 and enter their valid 10 digit phone number  and the app will 
display all of their information.
When you enter 5, all of your contacts will be displayed.
When you enter 6, this exports your contacts from this app to a seperate text file
And of course once you enter 7, this will allow you to quit
